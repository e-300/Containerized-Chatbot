# DevOps Assistant MVP
A containerized AI assistant specialized in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and platform engineering topics. 
Built with production-ready practices including monitoring, CI/CD automation, and container orchestration.


## Overview
This project demonstrates how to take an LLM-powered application from concept to production-ready deployment. 
The assistant answers questions about Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, cloud services, and infrastructure best practices.
The surrounding infrastructure of this project aims for production ready software that utilizes containerization, observability, automated testing, and deployment pipelines.

## Why I Built This
I am a platform engineer in the making. Understanding how software runs in a production environment and how to effectively deploy, monitor, scale, and maintain software fascinates me. 
I built this project to sharpen those skills. The function of the agent is cool, but from my perspective, it is secondary to the platform it is built upon.
